# General Hardware Notes

The left keyboard has the following information in bootloader mode:

```
/dev/sde: SEC_TYPE="msdos" LABEL_FATBOOT="ADV360PRO" LABEL="ADV360PRO" UUID="0042-0042" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat"
```

The right keyboard has the following information in bootloader mode:

```
/dev/sde: SEC_TYPE="msdos" LABEL_FATBOOT="ADV360PRO" LABEL="ADV360PRO" UUID="0042-0042" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat"
```

No real way to distinguish the two from this alone.. but the labels may be useful for a user-prompted approach.
